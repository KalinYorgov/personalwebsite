    "date": "May 15, 2025",
    "content": "Cursor has transformed the way I approach coding, and in this blog post, I want to share my personal workflow, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers I utilize, and how I've structured my Cursor rules to boost my productivity and coding efficiency.\n\n### MCP Servers and Where to Get Them\n\nOne of Cursor's strengths lies in its extensibility through MCP servers. I found several incredibly useful MCP servers on [Smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai/). Here's a quick overview of the servers I rely on daily:\n\n- **Brave Search**: Provides powerful web search capabilities directly within Cursor.\n- **Server Sequential Thinking**: Ideal for structured thought processes and step-by-step logic.\n- **Puppeteer**: Useful for automating browser tasks, scraping, and interacting with web pages programmatically.\n- **Firecrawl**: My go-to for powerful scraping capabilities, mapping, and data extraction.\n- **Browser Tabs**: Allows managing browser tabs programmatically, which is excellent for multitasking and efficiency.\n\nHere's a snapshot of my current MCP server setup:\n\n![MCP Server Setup](https://i.postimg.cc/g0QVtJk0/image.png)\n\n### Learning Resources for Cursor\n\nStarting with Cursor can feel daunting, but several resources helped me significantly:\n- [Nick Craux's blog post on Cursor tips](https://www.nickcraux.com/blog/cursor-tips) was an invaluable starting point, full of actionable insights.\n- For structuring my Cursor rules, I closely followed this excellent guide on [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev/blog/cursor-rules), coupled with the official [Cursor documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai).\n\n### My Customized Cursor Rules Journey\n\nInitially inspired by [JeredBlu's YouTube tutorial on creating PRDs with Cursor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41xaJsJ8GVc&ab_channel=JeredBlu), I adopted his rule setup for managing my projects more effectively.\n\nLater, I stumbled upon the insightful article [\"AI Blindspots\"](https://ezyang.github.io/ai-blindspots/) by ezyang, which encouraged me to refine my approach further by adding custom rules to tackle specific blind spots and improve the quality of AI-assisted code.\n\n### Access My Complete Cursor Rules\n\nI've compiled all my global rules into a comprehensive document, `coding-best-practices.mdc`, which you can freely access and use as a reference for your own setup. Check it out on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/KalinYorgov/cursor-notebook/blob/main/coding-best-practices.mdc).\n\n### Adding Project-Specific Rules\n\nWhen starting a new project, I first clarify my tech stack, and then I selectively integrate specific Cursor rules from the extensive and helpful [awesome-cursorrules repository](https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules?tab=readme-ov-file#contents) maintained by PatrickJS. This targeted approach ensures my rules remain relevant, efficient, and optimized for the task at hand.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSetting up Cursor effectively has greatly enhanced my coding workflow, improved my efficiency, and elevated the quality of my outputs. I hope sharing my journey helps you find your own powerful workflow. I'd love to hear your own tips and experiences with Cursor!",

    "title": "The World in 2026: How Artificial Intelligence Will Reshape Everything",
    "date": "January 18, 2026",
    "content": "## TL;DR: AI in 2026 - Key Statistics\n\n- **30%** of enterprises plan to automate more than half their network activities using AI by year-end\n- **Only 14%** of organizations have agentic AI solutions ready for deployment\n- **40%+** of agentic AI projects will fail by 2027 due to legacy architecture issues (Gartner)\n- **37%** of companies plan to replace workers with AI\n- **77,999 jobs** eliminated by AI in 2025 across 342 tech company layoffs\n- **50 million U.S. jobs** face automation exposure\n- **28% pay premium** for workers with AI skills vs. peers\n- **90%** of online content may be AI-generated by 2026 year-end\n- **$4.9 billion** global AI drug discovery market in 2026 (45% annual growth)\n- **EU AI Act** becomes fully applicable August 2, 2026\n\n---\n\nSo I've watched Nate B Jones video https://youtube.com/watch?v=pOb0pjXpn6Q and decided to ask @perplexity_ai \"how will the world be different in 2026 with artificial intelligence\" and this is the answer:\n\n## The World in 2026: How Artificial Intelligence Will Reshape Everything\n\nArtificial intelligence has moved from experimentation into infrastructure. By 2026, AI is no longer a novelty technology being tested in corporate innovation labs—it's becoming the operational backbone of enterprise systems, the intermediary in consumer decisions, and the catalyst for one of the most significant workforce transformations in modern history. The world will feel materially different in three critical dimensions: how work gets done, how information flows, and how economic value distributes.\n\n### Agentic AI Moves from Pilots to Production—But With Massive Execution Gaps\n\nThe defining AI story of 2026 isn't simply that autonomous agents exist. It's that enterprises are discovering they haven't built the organizational infrastructure to actually deploy them at scale. Thirty percent of enterprises plan to automate more than half their network activities using AI-based intelligence by year-end, but the execution reality is far messier than the headlines suggest. [scrumlaunch](https://www.scrumlaunch.com/blog/ai-in-business-2026-trends-use-cases-and-real-world-implementation)\n\nToday, only 14% of organizations exploring agentic AI have solutions ready for deployment, and a mere 11% are actively running them in production. Forty-two percent haven't even finalized their strategic roadmap; 35% have no formal strategy whatsoever. The gap between aspiration and implementation reveals a critical insight: agentic AI requires organizations to redesign how work fundamentally happens, not simply layer intelligent agents onto existing human-centered processes. [deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends/2026/agentic-ai-strategy.html)\n\nThe critical failure point is operational. Legacy enterprise systems—built around APIs, ETL pipelines, and human workflows over decades—cannot natively support autonomous agent decisions made at machine speed. Gartner estimates that over 40% of agentic AI projects will fail by 2027 precisely because legacy architectures can't accommodate real-time agent execution. Leading organizations like Dell Technologies and Toyota are succeeding because they've made a deliberate strategic choice: reimagine end-to-end processes before deploying agents, rather than attempting to optimize existing workflows. [deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends/2026/agentic-ai-strategy.html)\n\nThis execution barrier matters because it defines the competitive landscape. By 2026, the winners aren't companies with the most sophisticated AI models—they're organizations that have successfully rebuilt their data architecture, modernized core systems, and restructured governance to allow autonomous decision-making at scale. For solo entrepreneurs and tech-forward creators like yourself, this translates to an opportunity: the organizations struggling with legacy system integration and process design are the ones most vulnerable to disruption by smaller, AI-native competitors. [deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends/2026/agentic-ai-strategy.html)\n\n### The Labor Market Bifurcates Sharply: Displacement and Emergence Run Parallel\n\nBy 2026, AI-driven job displacement transitions from abstract concern to concrete economic anxiety. Thirty-seven percent of companies plan to replace workers with AI, and the displacement is already visible: 77,999 jobs were eliminated by AI in 2025 across 342 tech company layoffs alone. Across the U.S., 50 million jobs face automation exposure, with entry-level positions bearing the heaviest burden. [humai](https://www.humai.blog/ai-job-market-2026-how-artificial-intelligence-will-reshape/)\n\nThe pattern is stark. Young workers (ages 20-30) in tech-exposed occupations face unemployment rates that have risen nearly 3 percentage points since early 2025. Recently hired workers and high-salary employees face the highest displacement risk as companies target immediate payroll optimization. This creates a winner-take-all dynamic: workers without AI skills command no premium; those with them earn 28% more than peers in equivalent roles. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-labor-trends-2026-whats-really-happening-jobs-why-you-gromyko-514ve)\n\nBut crucially, new roles are emerging simultaneously. AI ethics officers, prompt engineers, human-AI collaboration managers, and agent operations specialists didn't exist two years ago and are now in explosive demand. AI and machine learning engineers face a 40% hiring increase projected through 2027, with compensation ranges from $130,000 to $180,000+. Sixty percent of Fortune 100 companies are now appointing heads of AI governance. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-labor-trends-2026-whats-really-happening-jobs-why-you-gromyko-514ve)\n\nWhat matters for your positioning: the jobs being created are more interesting and better-compensated than those being displaced, but they require demonstrable AI literacy, not just theoretical knowledge. This is why hands-on experimentation with AI agents and automation—work you're already doing with trading bots and autonomous systems—builds a scarcer credential than traditional certifications ever could. Organizations training their workforce from January 2026 onward will be months or years behind those who've already embedded AI experimentation into daily practice.\n\n### The Economy Gains, But Distribution Is Unequal\n\nFrom a macro perspective, AI will generate genuine economic productivity gains. Researchers at Penn Wharton estimate AI will increase GDP levels by 1.5% by 2035, nearly 3% by 2055, and 3.7% by 2075. The peak annual productivity boost occurs in 2032 (0.2 percentage points), then gradually fades as adoption saturates. Over the 2026-2035 window, AI could reduce federal deficits by $400 billion. [knowledge.wharton.upenn](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/how-ai-could-lift-productivity-and-gdp-growth/)\n\nHowever, this aggregate growth masks significant distributional risk. Concurrent with these gains, consumer spending is likely to contract due to job insecurity and economic anxiety. Companies are simultaneously targeting labor cost reduction (roughly 25% on average from AI adoption) and attempting to maintain consumer demand through the same workforce they're automating. This structural tension—productivity gains offset by reduced consumer purchasing power—creates downside risk to consensus 2026 growth expectations. [cfr](https://www.cfr.org/article/will-artificial-intelligence-do-more-harm-good-us-growth)\n\nFor small business operators and entrepreneurs, the economic translation is straightforward: business-to-business automation is proliferating faster than business-to-consumer demand, creating arbitrage opportunities in B2B efficiency tools and services that help organizations migrate to agentic workflows.\n\n### Synthetic Content Becomes the Default; Trust Becomes Scarce\n\nBy 2026, synthetic media consumption is no longer a future scenario—it's the present baseline. Researchers estimate 90% of online content may be AI-generated by year-end. Even the more conservative reading—that 57% of web-based text has already been AI-generated or AI-translated—indicates synthetic content is now the dominant format, not an emerging category. [thelivinglib](https://thelivinglib.org/experts-90-of-online-content-will-be-ai-generated-by-2026/)\n\nThis shift has immediate downstream effects. AI-generated video production that required 20 minutes of processing last year now executes in 1 second on high-end GPUs. The realism improvements are dramatic: AI can now simulate lifelike physics, natural camera movement, and convincing background details. For creators, this means commodity-level production capabilities that once required studio equipment and teams are now available via API call. [hiaurora](https://hiaurora.ai/learning-vault/ai-content-creation-2026-and-beyond/)\n\nThe consequence is polarization. On one side, authentic human-created content becomes more valuable precisely because it's scarce and verifiable. Platforms are beginning to implement explicit mechanisms to separate human-made from synthetic content, giving users choice and creators a verifiable claim to authenticity. On the other side, mass-produced synthetic content (termed \"AI slop\") is flooding social platforms, e-commerce sites, and feeds, making discovery of original content increasingly difficult. [oneday](https://oneday.agency/blog/how-platforms-will-separate-human-and-ai-content-in-2026)\n\nFor your YouTube and content strategy: the competitive moat shifts from production quality (now commoditized) to voice, cultural relevance, and emotional authenticity. Audiences increasingly adopt the mindset \"I know this is AI, but does it resonate emotionally?\" AI-generated content that mimics existing patterns will be invisible; content with distinctive perspective and originality will command premium attention. [suzy](https://www.suzy.com/blog/the-top-consumer-ai-trends-of-2026)\n\n### Consumer Discovery and Commerce Restructure Around Conversational AI\n\nThe search engine—that 25-year-old interface paradigm where you type keywords and receive links—is being displaced by conversational AI systems that deliver direct answers and recommendations inside chat interfaces. This isn't incremental; it fundamentally changes how consumers find products, information, and services. [suzy](https://www.suzy.com/blog/the-top-consumer-ai-trends-of-2026)\n\nIn 2026, shopping journeys that once spanned awareness → consideration → research → purchase are collapsing into single conversational flows inside ChatGPT, Gemini, or proprietary assistants. Users ask follow-up questions, refine constraints, and complete transactions without ever leaving the interface. This creates a new gatekeeping dynamic: visibility no longer depends on ranking broadly; it depends on being relevant to a specific question the AI confidently answers. [suzy](https://www.suzy.com/blog/the-top-consumer-ai-trends-of-2026)\n\nThe downstream implication for content strategy is profound. Generic product pages and broad SEO targeting become nearly invisible. Highly specific, use-case-driven content designed to answer narrow consumer needs becomes the asset AI systems surface to users at decision moments. A YouTube creator or B2B content writer optimizing for \"how to set up a trading bot for small accounts\" will reach far more qualified intent than someone optimizing for \"trading automation\" broadly. [suzy](https://www.suzy.com/blog/the-top-consumer-ai-trends-of-2026)\n\nSimultaneously, AI is stepping into the role of personal life manager—handling calendars, shopping recommendations, financial decisions, and wellness optimization. This creates new service categories and platform lock-in dynamics. Brands that integrate seamlessly into AI-managed workflows win; those that require users to exit AI systems lose. [idc](https://www.idc.com/resource-center/blog/ai-gets-personal-a-glimpse-into-the-consumer-future/)\n\n### Healthcare Experiences Qualitative Leap in Drug Discovery\n\nThis is perhaps the most concrete area where 2026 marks a genuine inflection. Generative AI is compressing drug development timelines from 10-15 years to 3-6 years, with success rates for AI-designed molecules reaching 15-20% versus 1% through traditional methods. The global AI drug discovery market will reach $4.9 billion in 2026, growing at 45% annually. [aiworldjournal](https://aiworldjournal.com/2026-the-year-ai-reinvents-drug-discovery/)\n\nThese aren't marginal improvements. Molecules designed by AI systems like those from Chai Discovery are achieving experimental validation rates far above historical averages, and AI can now design compounds for previously \"undruggable\" targets—proteins that human medicinal chemists couldn't effectively target. By 2026, biopharmaceutical companies will rely on generative AI as a standard tool, not an experimental capability. [aiworldjournal](https://aiworldjournal.com/2026-the-year-ai-reinvents-drug-discovery/)\n\nFor patients, this means accelerated access to therapies for rare diseases, novel targets, and conditions where time-to-market is critical. For the industry, it represents a cost and timeline collapse that will restructure competitive dynamics—companies with robust AI-driven discovery platforms will gain substantial first-mover advantage in open therapeutic areas.\n\n### Regulation Becomes Mandatory; Fragmentation Increases\n\nThe EU AI Act becomes fully applicable on August 2, 2026, triggering mandatory compliance for any organization operating in European markets. High-risk AI systems must now meet strict documentation, testing, transparency, and human oversight requirements, with penalties for non-compliance reaching up to 7% of global revenue. [digital-strategy.ec.europa](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai)\n\nSimultaneously, 38 U.S. states enacted AI laws in 2025, and that fragmentation accelerates in 2026. Colorado's AI Act takes effect June 2026; Illinois's AI in Employment Law begins January 1, 2026. California continues expanding state-level AI regulation despite federal pressure. This creates a patchwork where national employers must comply with the most restrictive state requirements—effectively setting a regulatory floor that encompasses Colorado, California, and New York standards simultaneously. [natlawreview](https://natlawreview.com/article/ten-ai-predictions-2026-what-leading-analysts-say-legal-teams-should-expect)\n\nThe Trump administration's December 2025 executive order attempted to preempt state AI laws through federal authority, but faces constitutional challenges and bipartisan opposition. By 2026, this federal-state tension will remain unresolved, forcing enterprises to navigate dual compliance regimes without clear precedent. [nbcnews](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/2026-new-laws-states-elections-midterms-ai-obamacare-aca-paid-leave-rcna247602)\n\nFor organizations and individuals building AI systems: 2026 is the year compliance infrastructure becomes table stakes, not optional. The window for deploying unvetted AI systems at scale is closing.\n\n### The Infrastructure Opportunity: Where Real Value Accumulates\n\nZooming out, 2026 defines itself less by AI breakthroughs than by execution bottlenecks. The real opportunity isn't in building more sophisticated models—it's in solving the infrastructure, process, and governance layers that enable organizations to actually deploy them.\n\nConsider the arbitrage: enterprises are simultaneously desperate to automate and completely unprepared to execute it. Process redesign, legacy system modernization, agentic orchestration, FinOps frameworks, agent governance—these are not novel technologies. They're organizational practices that scale exponentially as agentic AI adoption accelerates. Organizations with demonstrated expertise in migrating workflows to agentic architectures, building multi-agent orchestration, or designing governance frameworks for autonomous systems will command premium positioning throughout 2026 and beyond.\n\nFor a technical founder with your profile—someone building trading agents, exploring AI automation, and deeply familiar with systems integration—2026 represents a window where early credibility in agentic implementation is scarce and command high premium in consulting, integration services, or tools that abstract away architectural complexity for mid-market customers.\n\n---\n\n**In summary**: 2026 is the year AI transitions from tool to infrastructure, job displacement becomes politically salient, synthetic content becomes the baseline, and organizations discover most were not ready to execute the transition they've been planning. The winners will be those who embedded AI literacy early, positioned for infrastructure demand, and understood that the competitive advantage lies not in AI capability but in organizational ability to redeploy it successfully.\n\n---\n\n## Physical AI, Robotics and Logistics\n\nHmm nothing is mentioned about physical AI, robotics and logistics, why? Physical AI is actually one of the biggest 2026 stories – robotics and logistics are just a bit less visible to consumers than chatbots and content, which is why they often get underplayed in general summaries. The short answer: warehouses, factories and last-mile delivery are being quietly rewired around AI-driven robots, and 2026 is the year this starts to look like \"normal infrastructure\", not pilots. [signitysolutions](https://www.signitysolutions.com/blog/logistics-ai-trends-predictive-to-proactive)\n\n### Why it wasn't in the first answer\n\n- The earlier overview focused on information work (agents, content, jobs, regulation), which is where most public debate and white-collar anxiety is centered.\n- Physical AI tends to show up in industry-specific sources (logistics, warehouse automation, robotics trade press), not in the more general \"future of AI in 2026\" articles that dominated that research set. [globaltrademag](https://www.globaltrademag.com/top-10-supply-chain-and-logistics-technology-trends-for-2026/)\n\nYou are absolutely right that ignoring physical AI gives an incomplete picture; the biggest capex and hardest ROI in 2026 are in robots and logistics.\n\n### What's happening in logistics and warehousing\n\n- **Warehouse robots go from nice-to-have to mandatory.** Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), robotic arms, and AI-vision sorters are now handling inbound de-palletizing, case transport, picking, and outbound fulfillment at scale, not just in Amazon-tier operations. This includes handling mixed pallets and irregular packaging using advanced gripping and 3D vision. [techtimes](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/313152/20251204/how-ai-warehouse-robots-are-revolutionizing-automation-jobs-robotics-trends-2026.htm)\n- **Smart and automated picking is a top 2026 trend.** Vendors highlight automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS) plus robotic shuttles feeding continuous picking flows as a flagship logistics trend for 2026. Warehouses are being redesigned as \"control centers\" where AI software coordinates robots, inventory, and transport in real time. [mecalux](https://www.mecalux.com/blog/logistics-trends-2026)\n- **Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS) lowers the barrier.** Instead of buying robots as capex, companies subscribe; robots become an operating expense, with maintenance and software handled by the provider. This lets smaller warehouses deploy automation 3–5× faster than owning fleets outright. [metaoption](https://www.metaoption.com/blog/metawms-advance-warehouse-solution/warehouse-automation-trends/)\n\nFor you: this is exactly the \"physical agent\" stack—AI doing perception and planning, robots doing actuation—and a lot of the value is now in orchestration software, dashboards, and exception-handling agents around these fleets.\n\n### Physical AI and \"agentic\" workflows\n\n- Analysts explicitly talk about **\"Physical AI\" and digital nervous systems** in 2026: robots, sensors and AI agents forming a tightly coupled system where software agents make decisions and physical robots execute them. [dbr77](https://dbr77.com/industrial-robotics-trends-2026/)\n- In logistics, specialized AI agents already monitor material flows, detect delays, and autonomously reroute loads or trigger alternative transport options without a human in the loop. Multiple agents operating in parallel create a kind of swarm intelligence linking planning, warehousing, and shipping in near real time. [trans](https://trans.info/en/ai-in-logistics-2026-446383)\n\nThis is the same agentic pattern you're interested in for trading, just hooked up to conveyors, shuttles, and mobile robots instead of order books.\n\n### Last-mile robots and drones\n\n- **Sidewalk robots and delivery bots are now commercial, not just pilots.** Serve Robotics has deployed over 2,000 delivery robots completing 100,000+ deliveries, and similar fleets are running in multiple U.S. cities. [fleetrabbit](https://fleetrabbit.com/blogs/post/last-mile-delivery-trends-2026)\n- **Drones are crossing into mainstream logistics.** Zipline alone has flown over 100 million autonomous miles and completed 1.4+ million commercial deliveries; national plans (e.g. the UK) expect drone deliveries to be \"commonplace\" starting 2026 as BVLOS trials move into full operations. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-drones-disrupt-urban-last-mile-delivery-2026-coptrz-cpgne)\n\nSo physical AI *is* very much part of how 2026 is different; it just sits in the background of consumer awareness compared to chat interfaces.\n\n### Why this matters strategically (for someone like you)\n\n- **Physical AI is hitting its \"warehouse 2010 → everywhere 2026\" moment.** First wave was mega-players; 2026 is mid-market adoption via RaaS and off-the-shelf AI logistics platforms. [centuryconveyor](https://www.centuryconveyor.com/warehouse_automation_conveyor_2026/)\n- **There's a software + agents gap.** Companies have robots but still lack good tools for exception handling, simulation, and multi-agent orchestration (exactly the kind of agent logic you're already thinking about, just with physical constraints).
